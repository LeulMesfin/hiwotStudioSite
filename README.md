# hiwotStudioSite

Developed a fully-responsive website utilizing Javascript, HTML, CSS, and React: a Javascript framework.
Met with the client extensively throughout the planning and development process. Made sure the development process
was transparent and the project was delivered on time.
Implemented back-end functionality to configure the email component of the website. Utilized the Google Maps Web
API to load the Salonâ€™s location onto the site.
